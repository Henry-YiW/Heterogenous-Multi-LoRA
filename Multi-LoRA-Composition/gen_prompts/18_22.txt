"Explore the dynamic energy of Goku in action, showcasing his compassion by supporting fellow enthusiasts through Patreon contributions or enjoying a coffee together as friends."

In this prompt, we've combined the Trigger Words with the Metadata to create an image that positively reflects the community spirit around the character Goku. It also subtly encourages support for creators in ways mentioned in the Lora without directly soliciting donations or purchases but rather promoting camaraderie and mutual assistance, which aligns well with the thematic elements of "support" found in both the prompt metadata and the Trigger Words.
