Name: Handdrawn


Description:Optimized the overall line, making it smoother and clearer,

Very good generalization, just control the screen with prompt words

Remember to write the trigger word 'lineart' and try weights

Low weight enhances character edge contours, while high weight approaches watercolor stroke style more closely

What sets it apart from the line draft is that the lines are thicker and the image is more precise

Different anime film styles are also different, which can be watercolor pen, pure cartoon, pen and other styles

As can be seen in the example picture~

In addition, you can directly add colors to the screen, reduce the weight to around 0.7, or enhance the weight of prompt words

Finally, you can use Controlnet's lineart and other tools to draw character images, as shown in the sample image Inspired by a Tik Tok anchor,

Simple lines, slightly inclined towards cartoon character portraits.

Both monochrome and color options are available, with the initial goal of allowing everyone to quickly draw

A simple portrait of a character in a style similar to hand drawn water pen,

I have tried various proportions and the results are quite impressive. It is recommended to turn on ADetailer for the full body image

Adding details can enable high-definition redrawing or other Loras,

It is recommended to use Controlnet's lineart realism for character portraits

The recommended weight is generally around 0.7-1, or you can try small weights, which may bring surprises

All examples are directly displayed with the prompt words on the cover map. It is suggested that the anime bottom film be the main part,

Use a real person mask to create a black and white image. The example image has practical effects and can be used as a black and white filter
