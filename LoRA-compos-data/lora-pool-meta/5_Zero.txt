Name: Zero Suit (Metroid) Outfit LoRA


Description: The Zero Suit from the Metroid series. Trained on NAI. Tested at 0.8-1.0 strength.

Add "zero suit, blue gloves, high heels" to have your character wear this outfit.

This was a byproduct of the Samus LoRA. Probably doesn't work on male characters from my testing, sadly. (EDIT: Apparently men can wear it with some coaxing. This changes everything.)
